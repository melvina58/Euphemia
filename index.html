                <h3>HTML5 markup language</h3>
                <p>HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is the latest version of the HTML standard, used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It introduces new elements and features that improve website
                     functionality and multimedia support. HTML5 is essential for building modern web pages and applications, providing better support for audio, video, graphics, and interactive content. It's also designed to 
                     work seamlessly on various devices, making it a cornerstone of responsive web design. HTML5 plays a vital role in shaping the structure of web pages and how they function, ensuring a richer and more dynamic

                     from logos and posters to web graphics and advertisements. Graphic design is essential in marketing, branding, and communication, and it plays a significant role in creating visually appealing and effective

                <h3>React development</h3>
                <p>React development is the process of building user interfaces for web applications using the React library. React, developed by Facebook, is a JavaScript library that enables developers to create dynamic, responsive,
                     and interactive UIs. It's widely used in front-end web development to efficiently update and manage the display of data, making it a popular choice for single-page applications and component-based development. React
                      simplifies the creation of complex, interactive web applications and is known for its reusable and modular component structure.</p>
